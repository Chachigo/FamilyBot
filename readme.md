And voil√†! Your bot is ready, and before leaving the Discord developer portal, you'll just need to get the Discord bot Token as it will be used to control the bot.

In the Bot part, click on "reset token" and copy the token and save it in a text file for the moment.
 
### Configuration
fill the required data in the ``config-template.yml`` file and rename it to ``config.yml``  
#### Discord ID
To get the Discord IDs, you will need to enable the developer mode in the advanced parameters of the app.  
Then, you can left-click on your profile picture in the lower left corner and copy your user ID.  
To get the Discord channels ID, just right-click on the channels and copy the ID of the channel. 
#### Steam ID

To get the Steam Family ID, we will use this site: https://steamapi.xpaw.me/
At the beginning of the site, you will need to fill the token and the Steam ID fields.

For the Steam ID, go to this site and paste your profile URL: https://steamdb.info/calculator/, then your Steam ID will be displayed like this:

And to get your Steam Token, use this link: https://store.steampowered.com/pointssummary/ajaxgetasyncconfig and copy the webapi_token value in quotes. If you don't have any value, log in to Steam in another tab, then refresh the token tab.

If the values you entered in the fields are correct, it will look like this:

### Token Sender installation and configuration
#### Requirements
- Firefox
- Python 
#### Configure Firefox for Selenium

Unfortunately, since there is no other way to get the Steam token than getting it with a browser that is connected to the Steam account, I used Selenium to automatically gather the token and send it to the server through WebSocket.

So, for Selenium to achieve the token gathering, it needs to already be connected to Steam. To do this, in Firefox, you can create multiple profiles that keep cookies, extensions, etc.

You will need to create a new profile on Firefox. To do this, you must copy and paste this in the address bar: **about:profiles** then click on create a new profile. It will open a small window like this:

![Create Firefox Profile](doc/Create_Firefox_Profile.png)

Note that it shows the path of the profile, and you will need it for the configuration.

When it's done, start the profile in a new browser and log in to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). 

#### complete the configuration file
In the Token Sender 's config.yaml, just set the same IP address that you set in the bot config, and in **"token_save_path"**, the directory where you want to save the token. The shutdown property is to set to true if you want to shut down your computer after sending the token; you can change it even if the script is already started.

For the **"firefox_profile_path"** use the complete path and make sure to use **/** and not **\\** 

To start the script on startup, create a **.bat** script in *C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup* like this:

```
python3.10.exe <SCRIPT_PATH>\getToken.py
```
