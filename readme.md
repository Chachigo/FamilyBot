It will ask you to connect and select the server where you want to add it.

6. Then, it will ask you to grant administrator permissions; click on Authorize.

And voil√†! Your bot is ready. Before leaving the Discord developer portal, you'll need to get the Discord bot Token as it will be used to control the bot.

In the Bot part, click on "reset token" and copy the token and save it in a text file for now.
